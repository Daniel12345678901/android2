Aesthetic Improvements to Consider First

    1. Mosaic Style Display
        Display notes in a mosaic style with two notes wide starting from the left.

    2. Automatic Edit Mode
        Instead of an edit button for each note, automatically open a page showing the full note with edit capabilities when a note is clicked.

    3. Hold to Delete
        Instead of a delete button for each note, implement a press-and-hold action that shows a blank circle on the top right corner of each note. The user can press to show a check mark for selection. When at least one note is selected, display a delete button on the top right corner.
