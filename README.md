Features to Add Later

    Search Notes by Title
        Allow users to search for notes by their title.

    Enhanced Note Features
        Add support for rich text formatting (bold, italics, underline, etc.).

    User Customization
        Allow users to switch between light and dark themes.

    Voice Input
        Enable users to use the microphone to dictate notes.

    Add Pictures
        Allow users to add pictures to their notes.

    Drawing Capability (Optional)
        Provide an option for users to draw within their notes (this feature may be unnecessary).

    To-Do List Integration
        Allow users to create to-do lists inside their notes. Each item will have a circle on the left side that can be checked to show a check mark and strike through the text.

Aesthetic Improvements to Consider First

    Mosaic Style Display
        Display notes in a mosaic style with two notes wide starting from the left.

    Automatic Edit Mode
        Instead of an edit button for each note, automatically open a page showing the full note with edit capabilities when a note is clicked.

    Hold to Delete
        Instead of a delete button for each note, implement a press-and-hold action that shows a blank circle on the top right corner of each note. The user can press to show a check mark for selection. When at least one note is selected, display a delete button on the top right corner.
